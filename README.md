# Introduction
We developed a novel application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm applied to a Structural Equation Model for predicting structure of a gene network and predicting Beta coefficients. 

# Results
The paper is currently being written for this project. The code for this project was written in R and prints out the results of the estimation of the algorithm. We start this with a simulated example.
